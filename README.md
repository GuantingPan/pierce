## Welcome to Pierce

We present Pierce, a flexible testing infrastructure that can be used to construct a variety of testing tools to test neural network verification tools. At its core, Pierce implements a fuzzing engine over the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) (version 13) and the VNN-LIB standard. We leverage Pierce to create a diverse benchmark suite for the community. Furthermore, to demonstrate high usability as a testing infrastructure, we build a relative performance fuzzer and use it to expose slowdowns in four state-of-the-art solvers.
